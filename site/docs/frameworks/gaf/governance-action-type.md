# Governance Action Type

A *governance action type* is a template for a [governance action](governance-action.md). A set of linked governance action types form the definition of a [governance action process](governance-action-process.md).

Governance action types are defined through the [Governance Engine OMAS](/egeria-docs/services/omas/governance-engine) and this OMAS also coordinates the creation of a governance action from the governance action type as part of its execution of the governance action process.

The governance action type is defined in the [0462 governance action type](/egeria-docs/types/4/0462-governance-action-types) model.
