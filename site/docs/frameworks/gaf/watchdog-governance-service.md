# Watchdog Governance Services

The *watchdog governance service* monitors changes in the metadata and initiates one of the following as a result:

- [governance action](governance-action.md)
- [governance action process](governance-action-process.md) 
- [incident report](incident-report.md)

One example of a watchdog governance service is to monitor for new assets. Another example is to monitor the addition of open discovery reports and take action on their content.
