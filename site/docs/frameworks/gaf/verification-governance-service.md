# Verification Governance Service

*Verification governance services* test the properties of specific open metadata elements to ensure they are set up correctly and do not indicate a situation where governance activity is required. The results returned from the verification governance service can be used to trigger other governance services as part of a [governance action process](governance-action-process.md).
