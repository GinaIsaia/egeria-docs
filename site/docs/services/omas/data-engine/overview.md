# Data Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Data Engine OMAS provides APIs and events for data movement/processing engines to record the changes made to the data landscape. 

It provides the ability to register the data engine itself along with the lineage details of the ETL transformations. 
Data Engine OMAS APIs offer support for creating the corresponding open metadata types for assets and jobs.
