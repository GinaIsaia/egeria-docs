# Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)

The engine services are each able to host a specific
type of governance engine. 

Broadly there are two types of governance engines:

- [Open discovery engines](/egeria-docs/frameworks/odf/#discovery-engine) that run automatic metadata
  discovery requests to analyze the content of an [asset's](/egeria-docs/concepts/asset) real-world counterpart.
- [Governance action engines](/egeria-docs/frameworks/gaf/#governance-action-engine) that
  manage the processing supporting governance processing such as the resolution of issues reported in the open
  metadata ecosystem or the assets it supports.

These engines are supported by the [Asset Analysis OMES](asset-analysis) and
[Governance Action OMES](governance-action) respectively.
