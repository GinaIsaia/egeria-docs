# Platform Services

The platform services provide the APIs for querying the [Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platform](/egeria-docs/concepts/omag-server-platform) and discovering information about the [OMAG Servers](/egeria-docs/concepts/omag-server) that it is hosting.

There are two parts to the platform services:

- The *OMAG Server Platform Origin Service* returns a platform identifier that indicates which version of the platform is running.
- The *OMAG Server Platform Active Service* returns information about the known and active servers running on the platform along with definitions of each type of Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) services.
