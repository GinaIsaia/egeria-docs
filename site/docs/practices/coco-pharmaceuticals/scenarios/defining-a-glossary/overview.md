# Defining a glossary

A [glossary](/practices/common-data-definitions/anatomy-of-a-glossary) is a collection of common data definitions, typically focused on defining the meaning of data. The process of building a glossary is iterative and collaborative.  It switches between creating a overview of the content and then drilling down into the specifics, increasing the precision, before returning to review the overall consistency of the definitions.

Often organizations begin with a simple exercise to identify the broad topics that need to be covered. These broad topics are called *Subject Areas*.  In an earlier scenario, [Erin Overview](/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/erin-overview) created an initial list of [Subject Areas for Coco Pharmaceuticals](/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/scenarios/defining-subject-areas/overview).   

In this scenario, Erin is working with [Faith Broker](/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/faith-broker) the director for human resources on the employee data subject area.
