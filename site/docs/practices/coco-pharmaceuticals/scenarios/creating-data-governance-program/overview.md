# Creating a data governance program

![Icon](/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/jules-keeper.png)

[Jules Keeper](/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/jules-keeper) is the Chief Data Officer (CDO) for Coco Pharmaceuticals. He is responsible for improving the management and use of their information. This includes the information governance program.

When Jules joined Coco Pharmaceuticals the rules for handling data were documented on an internal website. They defined how researchers should manage data for clinical trials in order to be compliant with FDA regulations.

A recent fraud incident with a bogus supplier and demands to use more data by the clinical research teams showed that the company should have a more focused approach to information governance - and so Jules was appointed CDO.

In this scenario we walk through the steps that Jules takes to set up a governance program for Coco Pharmaceuticals.This includes:

* Defining classification schemes for information, technology capability, roles and activities.

* Defining policies and rules that specify how information of each classification should be handled when working with a particular classification of technology or performing a certain classification of activity in a particular context.

* Making the governance program actionable by assigning governance roles and responsibilities, providing education and commissioning new IT projects to improve the automation of the information landscape.
