Top challenges:

* Constant demand for data extracts from the business teams.
* New software packages being deployed with no thought for
how the data within it will be supported.
* No budget to increase the size of her team â€“ nor
automate some of the common requests.

their quality and how the information is flowing between them.
* An easy way to communicate with the developers and
business about their responsibilities around data.
* Some way of making common requests for data repeatable and self-service.
* Appreciation for her teams efforts.
