# Tessa Tube - Lead Researcher

![Icon](tessa-tube.png)

Age: 47

Skills:
Cancer specialist working on new drugs to improve the effectiveness of
leukemia treatments.

Scope: Cancer research team

Job: 

* Tessa has been developing a new drug that is currently in clinical
trials with a number of hospitals.
* The medical staff at each hospital are following a well defined
protocol and are supplying new data about the selected patients’ progress
as they are tested with the new drug.
* Tessa divides her time between her lab and the hospitals
involved in the trial.
* She has strong relationships with the medical staff involved in the trial.

Thinks/Feels:

* Tessa is optimistic about this new drug’s effectiveness.
* However, she knows that this area of medicine is complex and
a patient’s response is affected by many factors.

Hears:

* Many different aspects of the cancer treatment that are not being recorded.

Says/Does

* Tessa spends a lot of time discussing the progress of the trial with
the patients and medical staff involved in the trial,
trying to capture as much information as possible.

Sees:

* A willingness on the part of all concerned in the trial to collaborate
to get the drug right – but a difficulty in expressing and collecting
the right information since new factors are being discovered all of the time.

Top challenges:

* Collecting information where the understanding of which factors are
important to record is evolving.

Desired Outcome:

* A record of the clinical trial that documents both the data required
by the FDA, but also the incidental detail and additional insight
that the team discovered during the trial.
