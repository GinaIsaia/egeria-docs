# Bob Nitter - Application Developer

![Icon](bob-nitter.png)

Age: 47

Skills: Software systems, programming languages, simple integration concepts (JMS, Services).

Scope: IT Project.

Job: 

* Bob is an experienced developer with good understanding of the types of systems that the company owns. 
* He has spent most of the last five years connecting systems together using JMS, services, python scripts and other integration technology including ETL.  

Thinks/Feels:

* Bob thinks that the internal systems need serious rationalization. In their current form he recognizes he has a job for life! 
* He finds it hard to be sure he is using the best source of data and function when implementing his integration services.

Hears:

* Concerns that he works too slowly and is old-fashioned in approach. They say, “if only he used agile development then he could create services much quicker.”

Says/Does:

* Much of Bob’s time is spent installing tools, connecting to systems, testing different approaches to find out what works and hardening that. 
* He is unsure he is integrating the systems the best way – he often just has time to get “something” working.

Sees:

* Complexity in the integration space with different tools, terminology, technology and philosophy. 
* Security is different in each systems and data is silo-ed and inconsistent. 
* People just want a simple interface to call – they don’t care what is behind it.

Top challenges:

* Creating new back end services that support mobile application, other systems of engagement and provisioning in and out of the data lake.

Desired Outcome:

* He wants to go back to building new systems and function for the business rather than spending his time cobbling the existing systems together.
