# Historical Queries and Effectivity Dates

Within every open metadata element there are four timestamps that provide a time dimension to metadata that allows you to:
 
- understand not just was is stored in the metadata now, but what was known at a particular moment in time.

- define when a particular element is effective (ie visible and active) and when it ceases to be effective.
 
This time dimension enables some very important use cases.
