## Support for templated cataloguing

The [Asset Owner OMAS](/services/omas/asset-owner/overview), [Asset Manager OMAS](/services/omas/asset-manager/overview), [Data Manager OMAS](/services/omas/data-manager/overview), [IT Infrastructure OMAS](/services/omas/it-infrastructure/overview) and [Digital Architecture OMAS](/services/omas/digital-architecture/overview) provides the ability to set up and use templates to catalog new assets.

## Adding automation

It is also possible to use templates in the integration connectors running during [Integrated cataloguing](/feaatures/integrated-cataloguing).  The connector is typically passed the qualified name of the template that it should use in its configuration properties.
