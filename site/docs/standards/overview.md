# Open Metadata Specifications and Standards

Egeria is build up with layers of open components that build on many open standards relevant to metadata management and governance.  Open standards further influence the implementation of the Egeria libraries.

* [Metadata Metamodel](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/repository-connector/metamodel/overview) defines
how metadata is structured and organized through an open and extensible type system.

* [Open Metadata Types](/egeria-docs/types) shows the pre-defined types included with Egeria.
These types have been built and are loaded into a [metadata server](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/cohort-member.md).

* [Open Metadata Repository Cohort Event Payloads](/egeria-docs/concepts/cohort-events) define the structure of the events that flow between members of an [open metadata repository cohort](/egeria-docs/concepts/cohort-member).

* [Open Metadata Archive Format](/egeria-docs/concepts/open-metadata-archives) - describes how to package up metadata into a portable format for back up and sharing.

* [Open Metadata Frameworks](/egeria-docs/frameworks) - define the Java interfaces for building connectors and other plug-in components for Egeria.
