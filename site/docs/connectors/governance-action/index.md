They run in the [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action) hosted by the
[Engine Host OMAG Server](/egeria-docs/concepts/engine-host).

The definition of the connector interfaces for governance action services is defined in the [governance-action-framework :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/governance-action-framework) module.
