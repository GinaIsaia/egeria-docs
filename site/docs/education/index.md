# Learning about Egeria

Egeria is a big project tackling a complex problem.  There is a lot to learn.  The choices below give you the opportunity to target your learning to both your immediate and long term needs. 

## The Egeria dojos

The [Original Egeria Dojo](/egeria-docs/getting-started/egeria-dojo) provides guided learning to help you get up to speed quickly with different topics.  It has 3 parts:

* Learn how to set up and run Egeria on you own machine.
* Learn how to make a contribution to Egeria.
* Learn how to become either an advocate or a maintainer.

It is organized so you can work through it as an intensive 3 day course, or work at you own pace, dipping in and out as the interest takes you.

Since the original Egeria dojo was written, Egeria's capabilities have grown significantly.  As a result, the Egeria community is building a new set of 5 dojos, each a day long.

## Hands on Labs

The [Hands on Open Metadata Labs](/egeria-docs/education/open-metadata-labs/overview) provide an interactive environment that allow you to experiment with different capabilities of Egeria.  They are organized by role so you can select the roles of interest to you.

## Individual tutorials

The individual tutorials focus on a specific tool, or group of related tasks.  They allow you to pick the education needed for a specific task.
