## Jupyter Notebooks

[Project Jupyter :material-dock-window:](https://jupyter.org){ target=jupyter } provides tools for interactive computing. In particular, we use Jupyter notebooks to provide an interactive environment for running snippets of [Python](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/languages/#python) code, interspersed with [Markdown](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/languages/#markdown) documentation, for our [hands-on labs](/egeria-docs/education/open-metadata-labs).
