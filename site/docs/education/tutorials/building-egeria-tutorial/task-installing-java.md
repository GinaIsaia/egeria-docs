### Installing Java

You will need a **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine in order to build Egeria.
There are various JDKs available, and you may even have one pre-installed on your system. You can check
if java is already installed by running the command `java -version` from the command-line.

Java can be installed by:

1. Downloading the **OpenJDK 11 (LTS) HotSpot** JVM from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
5. Running the installer that is downloaded.
