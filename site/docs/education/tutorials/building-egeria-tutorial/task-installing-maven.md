### Installing Maven

Maven is the tool used to run the Egeria build.
You can check if Maven installed by running the command `mvn --version` from the command-line. Ensure you are using version 3.5.0 or higher in order to build Egeria.

Maven can be installed:

- On MacOS, by first installing the [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) package manager and then running `brew install maven` from the command-line.
- On Linux operating systems, by using your distribution's package manager (`yum install maven`, `apt-get install maven`, etc).
- On Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) Version 2 or above, install an appropriate Linux distribution, and follow the instructions for Linux.
