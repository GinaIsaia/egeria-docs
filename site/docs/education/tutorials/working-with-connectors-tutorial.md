# Working with connectors

A connector is a client library for accessing an
[asset](/egeria-docs/concepts/asset).
ODPi Egeria provides a framework
called the Open Connector Framework (OCF) for writing, configuring and using connectors.

Typically a connector is written to support a specific type of asset.  It has
two main APIs:

* An API for working with the asset itself
* An API for retrieving metadata
