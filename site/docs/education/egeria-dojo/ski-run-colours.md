The dojo sessions are colour-coded like ski runs:

!!! beginner "Beginner session"

!!! intermediate "Intermediate session"

!!! advanced "Advanced session"

!!! expert "Expert session"

As you progress through the dojo, the colors of the sessions show how advanced your knowledge is becoming.

The schedule also includes estimated times needed to complete each session. Do take breaks whenever needed!
