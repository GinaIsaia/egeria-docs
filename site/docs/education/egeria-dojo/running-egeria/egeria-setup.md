# Egeria Setup

In this section you will set up the prerequisites that we are going to use to get
Egeria running, and to be able to make use of it's API

We are doing to setup:
 * A Kubernetes runtime where Egeria & other components will execute
 * An application to help making REST API calls to Egeria

! Note. At this time we do not fully support ARM processors including Apple Macs using m1 processors, nor raspberry pi. Addressing this is currently
work in progress. The remaining instructions will work for Intel based macOS, Windows & Linux.

## Setting up a Kubernetes runtime

! If you already have access to a Kubernetes runtime you can skip this section
