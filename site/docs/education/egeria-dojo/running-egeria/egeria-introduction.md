## Project Resources

### Source Code & Issue Tracking

Egeria is an open-source project available under the Apache-2.0 license. This is a permissive license that gives a lot of flexibility of what you can do with the software.

As with many open-source projects, Egeria is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), and divided into a number of repositories. 

Take a look at the [main Egeria repo](https://github.com/odpi/egeria). This is where the core code is stored, and where we track any [Issues](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues) in core Egeria.

As you work through this Dojo you may find problems with our documentation - perhaps something is wrong, or unclear. Our Documentation is managed in [egeria-docs](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-docs) and you can raise [Issues](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-docs/issues) there.

!!! note
    We will revisit these other repositories & explain what they are used for in more detail another day.

### Slack 

Another useful resource to help you as you work through these Dojo sessions - whether it is problems, questions, or about topics unrelated to the Dojo, you can [join](https://slack.lfai.foundation) our LF AI & Data Slack workspace. Once you've done so, look at the channels beginning 'egeria-'. '#egeria-dojo' has been set-up to support this learning activity.
