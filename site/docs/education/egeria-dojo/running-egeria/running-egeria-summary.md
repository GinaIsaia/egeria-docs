# Congratulations !

We have now nearly reached the end of the Dojo.

During this session we hope you've gained:

 - an understanding of what Egeria is
 - an opportunity to run the Egeria code live
 - been able to experiment with some interactions via the API & User Interface
 - a desire to want to know more and join our next Dojo session.

# Feedback

We hope this Dojo has been a useful experience for you & we'd love to hear your feedback about how it went.

Please let us know via the #egeria-dojo slack channel, or via a [github issue](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-docs/issues)

We're keen to take your feedback on board, and improve the sessions for the future.
