## Creating glossaries

**Recap:** A *glossary* is a collection of semantic definitions, typically focused on defining the meaning of data. The process of building a glossary is iterative and collaborative.  It switches between creating an overview of the content and then drilling down into the specifics, increasing the precision, before returning to review the overall consistency of the definitions.
