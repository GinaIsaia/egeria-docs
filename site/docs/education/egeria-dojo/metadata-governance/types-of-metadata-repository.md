## Types of metadata repository

Many metadata repositories are *data catalogs*.  They focus on gathering and organizing information about data sources for a team of data professionals.  Each data source is catalogued under the guidance of its users.  There is some automation for maintaining the catalogued data sources.  The aim is to provide the metadata needed by the local team.

There are also metadata repositories that focus on providing metadata to the whole enterprise. These repositories have a focus on common definitions and automation of metadata maintenance and stewardship.  They are deployed and controlled as a centralized service.  Some of these repositories are specialized for different types of use cases and often includes support for governance - for example, it may have a focus on Data Governance, IT Infrastructure Governance or Security Governance.

There are many tools and platforms that capture metadata as part of their operation. For example, a relational database has information about the data it stores (called the database schema) that is used to define and execute a query.  This metadata is used in tools that are building queries to the database - such as reporting, profiling and application development tools.

The open metadata ecosystem seeks to bring this metadata together so each store is enhanced and linked to deliver higher value to the organization that they offer as independent solutions.
