# Webinar - New Approaches to Managing Access to Sensitive Data 

**Date:** 6th December 2010

What happens when you need your data scientist to repeatedly work with your most valuable
and sensitive data?  How do you prevent them from seeing more than they need whilst ensuring
that they have a productive and enabling work environment.
In this webinar we look at 3 different approaches to managing secure access to data sets that include
the most personal and sensitive data.
 
In each approach we use increasing automated means to create selective access to an employee data set
that includes correlated personal, performance and financial information.
The technology involved is all open source and includes ODPi Egeria and Palisade.
Together they will change the way you think about access control.
