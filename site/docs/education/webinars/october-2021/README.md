# The Value of Egeria

**Date:** 4th October 2021

Presenter: Mandy Chessell

This session is for people wanting to understand the value of Egeria in enabling data 
centric, metadata driven integration. The session will start with the core Egeria 
constructs, including entities, explaining the principles behind why they are as they are. 
The session will go through the layers and aspects of the Egeria architecture,
at each stage talking about the applicability to solving real world problems. 

By the end of the session you should have awareness of the parts of Egeria at a high level, why
they have been implemented as they are and the value that each of the pieces bring.
