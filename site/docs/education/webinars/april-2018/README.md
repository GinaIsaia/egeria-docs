# Open Metadata Standards

**Date:** 26th April 2018

This presentation provides a description of the open metadata standards associated
with exchanging metadata across a cohort.  It is still accurate except for the chart that
describes Apache Atlas as the reference implementation for open metadata.
The reference implementation has moved to the [ODPi Egeria project](https://egeria.odpi.org/).
