# Managing Privacy

**Date:** 12th July 2018

There is increasing public awareness about the issues of data privacy. Individuals are concerned with how data about themselves is used in digital services, such as websites, and mobile apps.

In this webinar we will be discussing how an organization that offers digital services can manage data about individuals so that their privacy is respected and the organization is compliant with new regulations on data privacy such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

You will learn:

The life cycle of a digital service as it is developed, sold, enhanced and used. This life cycle breaks the work into six stages. Each stage describes the roles and the activities involved to ensure data privacy.
The types of artifacts that need to be collected about a digital service and the methods used to develop it.
How these artifacts link together in an open metadata repository (data catalog).
Finally we will demonstrate the ODPi's data privacy pack that provides documentation and open metadata definitions for a privacy program.

The ODPi's data privacy pack is the first open source initiative for data privacy. It is being developed by a team of cross-industry, multi-vendor data privacy experts. Join the call to find out more and maybe join the team to build your skills and share your expertise.
