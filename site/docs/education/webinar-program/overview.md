???+ education "Beyond cataloguing - December 2021 - Mandy Chessell"

    Peter Profile from Coco Pharmaceuticals is responsible for cataloging the weekly incoming data from the hospitals that are involved in their latest clinical trial.  The data scientists that use the catalog to locate and work with this data are full of praise for Peter's work. However, Peter is getting fed up with the repetitive, time-consuming nature of the cataloguing activity.  How can we help Peter to automate this cataloguing and extend the value of the catalog to the organization?

    In this session, follow Peter's journey from manual cataloging, to using automated integration and templating to create business relevant catalog entries.  He also adds metadata discovery to extract profile information about the incoming data values and enables metadata governance features (such as deduplication) to improve the quality of the catalog.  Finally, he creates automated notifications to the stewards responsible for the data if any issues occur that need a human touch.

    The result is that Peter is relieved of the tedious cataloguing tasks and Coco Pharmaceuticals sees increased value from their catalog.
