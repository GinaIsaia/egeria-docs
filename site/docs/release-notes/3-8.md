# Release 3.8 (May 2022)

* The Eco system UI (React UI) has a new capability. You can now issue queries in the past and 
if the repository supports it you can work with Rex at a time in the past. This cabability is available in
release [3.8.1](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/releases/tag/V3.8.1). 3.8 has a bug such that the Repository Explorer Explore button errors
in many scenarios.
