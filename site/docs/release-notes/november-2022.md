# November 2022

This is November's monthly report from the Egeria community.  


## Security


## Connectors

### Database support

The JDBC connectors have been tested with the **Trino** database.

### Integration connectors

There is a new sample integration connector that listens on an event topic that is supplying proprietary lineage data and transforms and publishes it into the open metadata ecosystem.

## Data products

This month we clarified the relationship between a subject area and a data domain. See [Subject Area Domain](/concepts/subject-area/#subject-area-domain).

## Community news


## Core Egeria


!!! info "Core Egeria Releases"
    [Release 3.13](/release-notes/3-13) was shipped in early November 2022.  The work this month is contributing to [Release 3.14](/release-notes/3-14).


## Events

### Metadata Governance Dojo

The big event this month was the new [Metadata Governance Dojo](/education/egeria-dojo/metadata-governance/overview).  We held two live sessions (3 hours each) and extended the discussion of the governance engines to one of the community calls.  The topics covered the philosophy and purpose of metadata governance, details of the operation of the [Integration Daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon) as well as [governance processes](/concepts/governance-action-process) and [services](/concepts/governance-service) running in the [Engine Host](/concepts/engine-host).  There are also sections on building the materials for a [subject area](/concepts/subject-area), [incident reporting](/concepts/incident-report), [lineage](/concepts/lineage) and [templated cataloguing](/features/templated-catalouing/overview).


### Community Meetings

Over the last few community meetings ...

* [Truly Open Lineage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNbGa1iDri4) - covering the integration of the Egeria, Marquez and OpenLineage projects.

## New documentation pages
