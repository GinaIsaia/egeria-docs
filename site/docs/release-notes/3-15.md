## Release 3.15 (January 2023)

_**These are DRAFT release notes, initially copied from the previous release
The notes will be updated until & when 3.15 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"

    * A new attribute called *waitTime* has been added to the [*GovernanceActionType*](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Types) entity type to allow delays to be added into a process definition.
    * A new attribute called *completionMessage* has been added to the [*GovernanceAction*](/types/4/0463-Governance-Action) entity type to allow a message from the governance service on the results of the action or the reasons why it failed.
    * A new attribute called *completionMessage* has been added to the [*TargetForAction*](/types/4/0463-Governance-Action) relationship type to allow a message from the governance service on the results of the processing the target or the reasons why it failed.
    * Appropriate properties have been added to the [*DigitalProduct*](/types/7/0710-Digital-Service) classification.  These were missing from its original definition in release 3.13.
    * A new relationship called [*DigitalServiceProduct*](/types/7/0710-Digital-Service) links a *DigitalService* to a *DigitalProduct*.
    * The [*DigitalServiceOperator*](/types/7/0715-Digital-Service-Ownership) can now be any *Referenceable* rather than being restricted to a *Team*.
    * The [*SolutionLinkingWire*](/types/7/0735-Solution-Ports-and-Wires) relationship can link any *Referenceable* rather than being restricted to a *SolutionPort*.  This means that solution ports can be wired to [DigitalProducts](/types/7/0710-Digital-Service) and other artifacts that they interact with.

??? functional "Change in unique attribute checking for OMAS entity creation" 

     The generic handler is used by OMAS's to perform common tasks. One of those tasks is to create an Entity bean.
     As part of this bean creation, the code checks that unique values are unique by searching for existing entities of the 
     type of the bean to be created. The code has been changed in this area to check Entities using the type where the
     unique attribute is defined (i.e. potentially a super type).
     For example if a [GlossaryTerm](/types/3/0330-Terms/) entity is being created, instead of checking that the [qualifiedName](/parameters/qualified-name) is unique within 
     all entities with type [GlossaryTerm](/types/3/0330-Terms/), it now checks that the [qualifiedName](/parameters/qualified-name) is unique within all entities with type 
     [Referencable](/types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable)
