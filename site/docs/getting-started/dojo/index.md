# Dojo introduction

The Egeria "dojo" is an intensive course to help you learn about Egeria.
It is designed as a 3-day effort, although, since it is self-study you can
dip in and out of it as time permits.

The objectives of the three day are as follows:

- **Day 1**: Learning about setting up and running Egeria on you own machine.
- **Day 2**: Learning how to make a contribution to Egeria.
- **Day 3**: Learning how to become either an advocate or a maintainer.

The sessions are color-coded like ski runs:

!!! beginner "Beginner session"

!!! intermediate "Intermediate session"

!!! advanced "Advanced session"

!!! expert "Expert session"

As you progress through the dojo, the colors of the sessions
show how advanced your knowledge is becoming.

The schedule also includes estimated times needed to complete each session.
Do take breaks whenever needed!
