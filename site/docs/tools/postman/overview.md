# Postman

Postman provides an interactive application for issuing
REST API calls to a server.

If Postman is new to you, and you do not have it installed,
link to the Postman page in the
[developer tools](/egeria-docs/tools/runtime/#postman) for
installation instructions.

Once Postman is installed, start up the application.

You should see a user interface something like this:

![Postman user interface](/egeria-docs/tools/postman-client.png)

The beauty of Postman is that it supports collections of
environments and requests.  This means we can pre-can
descriptions and implementations of different
requests to Egeria that can be widely shared.
