# Planning for security

The Egeria runtimes have been designed so that they can be deployed securely.  However, the security of your solution depends on a combination of the deployment environment as well as Egeria itself.

## Understanding the threats to your solution

The first phase in securing your solution is to understand the threats that need to be guarded against.  This understanding is developed through threat modelling.  **OWASP** has an excellent guidance pave called the [Threat Modelling Process](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process) that explains how to identify the threats that could compromise your system.

*Description of how this applies to the Egeria ecosystem goes here.*
