# 0417 Governance Projects

The roll-out of a governance program is typically divided into projects that are grouped together into a campaign (see [Projects](/types/1/0130-Projects) in Area 1).
The **GovernanceProject** classification tags these projects to make it easy for the governance team to identify them.
