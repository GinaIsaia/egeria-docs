# Governance server

Governance servers host specific integration or governance connectors for technology that does
not integrate directly with open metadata.

![Governance server](governance-server.png)

These are the different types:

- [Engine hosts](engine-host.md) - host governance engines for active management of the open metadata ecosystem.
- [Integration daemons](integration-daemon.md) - manage the exchange of metadata with third party technologies.
- [Data engine proxy](data-engine-proxy.md) - captures information about processes and the data sources that they work with and catalogs them in open metadata.
- [Open lineage server](open-lineage-server.md) - accumulates lineage information to provide a comprehensive historical reporting service for lineage.
