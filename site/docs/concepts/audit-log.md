# Audit log

The audit log provides detailed information relating to the activities
within an [OMAG server](omag-server.md).

It builds on the [Audit Log Framework](/egeria-docs/frameworks/alf)
to support multiple destinations for the audit log records written to the
audit log by the server's subsystems.

Details of the supported audit log store connectors and
how to set them up are described in the various sub-sections of the
[configuring an OMAG server](/egeria-docs/guides/admin/configuring-an-omag-server) portion of the administration guide.
