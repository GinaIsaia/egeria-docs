# Component description

The component description is a collection of properties that describes a component.  A component could be, for example, an [OMAG Subsystem](/concepts/omag-subsystem) or a [connector](/concepts/connector).

When the component registers with the [audit log](/concepts/audit-log), it supplies the component description that should be added to each audit log record produced by the component.
