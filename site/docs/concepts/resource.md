# Resource

The term *resource* is used throughout the Egeria documentation to refer to something - either physical or digital - that is of value to the operation of the organization, or to the services it provides.

Resources are described in open metadata as [Assets](/concepts/asset).

In addition, the organization may capture many types of intellectual property the describe their operations in open metadata, such as, for example, a [glossary term](/practices/common-data-definitions/anatomy-of-a-glossary/#inside-a-glossary-term) or a [governance definition](/services/omas/governance-program/overview/#governance-definitions). These elements can be [linked to the asset](/patterns/metadata-manager/overview) to provide more information on the resource's content, significance and proper use to the people working with the resource as well as guiding automated processes that are managing and governing it.
