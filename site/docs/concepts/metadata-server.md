# Metadata Server

A *metadata server* is an [OMAG Server](omag-server.md) that hosts a metadata repository with native support for open metadata types and instances. It is able to be a [member of a cohort](/egeria-docs/services/omrs/cohort/#cohort-members) and so can exchange metadata with other members of the cohort.

The metadata server typically has the [access services](/egeria-docs/services/omas) configured and so can act as a [metadata access point](metadata-access-point.md). It is important to have at least one metadata server in each cohort in order to support all types of metadata.
