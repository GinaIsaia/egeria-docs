# To Dos

A **to do** is a record of an action.  It includes details of the action to perform
and the time frame it needs to be completed for.

To dos are normally created as a result of a meeting, or a process, such as a
[governance action process](/egeria-docs/conceepts/governance-action-process).

The requested action may be ad hoc in nature, or part of a stewardship
process that identified a specific action for an individual, or group of
individuals.

The creator of a to do is called the **originator**.
The person, or people assigned to complete the task are
called the **assigned resources**.  Assigned to dos are 
attached to one of their [roles](/egeria-docs/concepts/personal-roles) rather than
directly to their [personal profile](egeria-docs/concepts/personal-profile).

Each to do has a priority and a status:
* **Open** - no work has started.
* **In Progress** - work is ongoing.
* **Waiting** - work is on hold, typically blocked.
* **Complete** -  Work is completed.
* **Abandoned** - No work will happen.
