## Favorite collections

Collections are sharable lists of things.  A collection may, for example, be a member of a [useful metadata elements list](/egeria-docs/concepts/useful-resource) that is attached to multiple [anchors](/egeria-docs/concepts/anchor) such as communities and personal profiles.

There are three special types of collections managed by [Community Profile OMAS](/egeria-docs/services/omas/community-profile/overview) that are only attached to a single [personal profile](/egeria-docs/concepts/personal-profile). They are to manage collections of [assets](/egeria-docs/concepts/asset), projects and [communities](/egeria-docs/concepts/community) for the individual owner of the profile.
