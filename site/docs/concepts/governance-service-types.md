There are seven types of governance services.  Related governance services are [packaged together in a specific type of governance engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-engine-definition) and enabled in one or more [Engine Host OMAG Servers](/egeria-docs/concepts/engine-host).  They run in the appropriate [Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)](/egeria-docs/services/omes) as shown in the table below.

| Governance Service | Description | Governance Engine type | Engine Service |
| :----------------- | :-----------| :--------------------- | :------------- | 
| [Open Discovery Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview) | Analyses the content of an [Asset's](asset.md) real-world counterpart ([resource](/egeria-docs/concepts/resource)) in the digital landscape. (For example, if the asset describes a file, the open discovery service analyses the data stored in the file). | [Open Discovery Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/open-discovery-engine) | [Asset Analysis OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/asset-analysis/overview) |
| [Watchdog Governance Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/governance-action-services/watchdog-governance-service) | Monitors changes to open metadata elements and when certain changes occur (such as the creation of a new [Asset](/egeria-docs/concepts/asset)) the watchdog service requests action from other governance services by creating either a [Governance Action](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action), a [Governance Action Process](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-process) or an [Incident Report](/egeria-docs/concepts/incident-report).| [Governance Action Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-engine) | [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action/overview) |
| [Verification Governance Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/governance-action-services/verification-governance-service) | Tests the properties of specific open metadata elements to ensure they are set up correctly or do not indicate a situation where governance activity is required.  The [results](/egeria-docs/concepts/guard) returned from the verification service can be used to trigger other governance services as part of a [Governance Action Process](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-process). | [Governance Action Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-engine) | [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action/overview) |
| [Triage Governance Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/governance-action-services/triage-governance-service) | Makes decisions on how to handle a specific situation or incident.  Often this involves a human decision maker. | [Governance Action Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-engine) | [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action/overview) |
| [Remediation Governance Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/governance-action-services/remediation-governance-service) | Corrects errors in open metadata or the digital landscape it represents. | [Governance Action Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-engine) | [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action/overview) |
| [Provisioning Governance Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/governance-action-services/provisioning-governance-service) | Configuring, enabling, provisioning resources in the digital landscape.  Often these provisioning services manage the cataloguing of new assets and the lineage between them. | [Governance Action Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-engine) | [Governance Action OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/governance-action/overview) |
| [Archive Service](/egeria-docs/guides/developer/archive-services/overview) | Dynamically maintains [open metadata archives](/egeria-docs/concepts/open-metadata-archive). | [Archive Engine](/egeria-docs/concepts/archive-engine) | [Archive Manager OMES](/egeria-docs/services/omes/archive-manager/overview) |
