# Relationship Linkage Rules

## Uni-link relationships

*Uni-link* means there is only one instance of the relationship between two specific entity instances (even though the cardinality may allow an entity to be linked to multiple other entries using this relationship).  


## Multi-link relationships

*Multi-link* means multiple instances of the relationship may be present between two entities.  In this case, the relationship properties are significant in identifying the significance of each relationship instance.
