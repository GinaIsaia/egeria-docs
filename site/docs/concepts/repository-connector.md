# Repository Connector

Repository Connectors link metadata catalogs into a cohort.

The OMRS Repository Connector API defines a call
interface to create, search, query, update and
delete metadata stored in a metadata repository.
The implementation of a specific OMRS connector
determines which type(s) of metadata repository it is able to access.
