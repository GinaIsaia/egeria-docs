??? development "In development"
    A component that is in development means that the Egeria community is still building the function. The code is added continuously in small pieces to help the review and socialization process. It may not run, or do something useful - it only promises not to break other function. Expect to find [git issues :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues) describing the end state.
